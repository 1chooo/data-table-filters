## About The Project

This is a standalone data-table demo that we will be using within the [OpenStatus](https://openstatus.dev) dashboard.

To make it not only more accessible for you to use, but also work on PoC/MVP with data-tables, we have started this repository. We will maintain it and add new examples over time.

It currently includes:

- data-table with simple pagination (see [/](https://data-table.openstatus.dev))
- data-table with infinite scroll and click details (see [/infinite](https://data-table.openstatus.dev/infinite))

The examples are heavily inspired by datadog and vercel log tables.

## Built With

Our stack is:

- [nextjs](https://nextjs.org)
- [tanstack query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
- [tanstack table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest)
- [shadcn ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- [cmdk](http://cmdk.paco.me)
- [nuqs](http://nuqs.47ng.com)

We will consider making an example with [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev) for all our raw react lovers. **Contributions are welcome!**
